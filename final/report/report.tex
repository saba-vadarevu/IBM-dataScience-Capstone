\begin{abstract}
Highly populated cities like Hyderabad, India are in sore need of more sports facilities. Such facilities must be set up in suitable locations, lest they go unused and become too expensive to maintain. How do we find suitable locations? This question is answered in the present report. Venue data from Google Places API is used to find how locations of existing sports facilities are related to locations of other venues, such as restaurants, schools, gyms, etc... This relationship is then exploited to find other locations in the city that are most suitable for a new sports facility.
